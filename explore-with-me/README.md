Activity 6 : Bootstrap

I have added a few bootstrap components to my Tourism website such as :

1. Nav bar: I have added this component at the top most section of the website which consists of various
   options such as 'about my page', 'my trip video', 'Explore' and 'Contact me'

2. Carousel: This is at the start of the website page right after the nav bar and is a website page template
   consisting of a carousel of sliding images of various destinations.

3. In-page reference links: I have also linked these nav bar options to specific sections on the webpage.
   So, when we click on any one of the options, it directs us to that particular section of the page.
