      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        During my Masters' at Pitt, I had the opportunity to do an internship in
        the University, where I worked for University of Pittsburgh Medical
        Center (UPMC). I worked as a Student Software Designer and was able to
        work on a research project under their mentorship. I chose to work with
        Biobank since I loved the idea of getting to work with researchers and
        patients for a Cancer related study and getting the chance to learn more
        about designing UI interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was on a team with 2 other students and we worked with the Professors,
        Researchers and Patients. The goal of this project was to design a
        software prototype of the NFT-based framework to help patients track and
        learn about any of their biological specimens that were collected and
        stored for research.
      </p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>
        I used Adalo to create the wireframes and prototype for the mobile
        screens.
      </p>

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>June to August 2022 (2 months)</p>

      <hr />

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of the project, my team had accomplished building a working
        mobile app and is also released on Google Play. My major role in this
        project was mainly designing wireframes and i was responsible for
        creating the initial front end design screens for patient experience.
        Further, my other team member used these wireframes to develop them into
        the Final app and my other team mate worked on backend NFT
        implementation to represent biosamples with new NFTs.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the design process, I also had to constantly interact with
        patients in the form of interviews and surveys in order to gain feedback
        on the app design. Their feedbacks were very valuable since patients
        were a crucial part of the entire user journey and this is a
        user-centric design. Based on the patient reviews, I had to further
        refine the front-end screens. I was expected to use a no-code platform
        such as Adalo to create these wireframes for the data from BIOS(patient
        data). At the moment, we can enable just current/former patients at UPMC
        to track their biosamples, but anyone can sign up to request the
        service.
      </p>

      <p>
        More details and deliverables are available in the embedded pdf doc and
        the link to Figma above respectively.
      </p>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          To enable more patients outside the UPMC network to track their
          biosamples.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over time, we hope to allow anyone who has donated their samples for
          research to be able to find their samples that are “banked” at any
          institution – wherever they received medical care.
        </li>
      </ul>
